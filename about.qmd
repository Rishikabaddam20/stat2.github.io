Good chart design are effective for information visualization, placing readability, accuracy, and context at the front so that a viewer can perceive and make meanings of underlying complex information easily at a glance. Well-designed charts apply the right types: for instance, line graphs are applied to show trends and bar charts for displaying comparisons. It has to be done in such a way that clutter and "chart junk" are avoided. They use color with a purpose to allow data differentiation without overwhelming the viewer, along with clear labels, titles, and legends for context. Bad graphs deceive or mislead through faulty data representation, inappropriate scale or type of graph, and missing labels. As a result, any such visualization escapes informative comprehension by the viewer of the data under representation. These key principles make visualizations in data powerful analytical and decision-making tools when followed.
