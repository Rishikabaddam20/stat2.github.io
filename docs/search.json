Effective charts use appropriate types, such as line graphs for trends and bar charts for comparisons, while avoiding clutter and “chart junk.” They utilize color purposefully to differentiate data without overwhelming the viewer and include clear labels, titles, and legends to provide context. In contrast, bad graphs can mislead or confuse by distorting data representation, using inappropriate scales or types, and lacking essential labels, ultimately hindering the viewer’s ability to derive meaningful insights from the data. By adhering to these key principles, data visualizations become powerful tools for analysis and decision-making."
