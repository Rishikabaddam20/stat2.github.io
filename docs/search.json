    "text": "Good chart design are effective for information visualization, placing readability, accuracy, and context at the front so that a viewer can perceive and make meanings of underlying complex information easily at a glance. Well-designed charts apply the right types: for instance, line graphs are applied to show trends and bar charts for displaying comparisons. It has to be done in such a way that clutter and “chart junk” are avoided. They use color with a purpose to allow data differentiation without overwhelming the viewer, along with clear labels, titles, and legends for context. Bad graphs deceive or mislead through faulty data representation, inappropriate scale or type of graph, and missing labels. As a result, any such visualization escapes informative comprehension by the viewer of the data under representation. These key principles make visualizations in data powerful analytical and decision-making tools when followed."

The trend is the visualization that Northern European countries are well ahead in the assimilation curve in the adoption of PEVs, while other regions, notably China and the USA, have room for significant improvement. More likely, government policies and infrastructure development have set up these trends. These countries would continue setting the pace for the transition of the world toward a decarbonized society by transitioning to electric vehicles.\nWhich is considered as bad graph There are few flaws with the visualization in this image which includes:-\n\nPacked Labels: There are a lot of labels and text within the bars on this chart, like the percentages at top them. This will make the visualization cluttered and hard to read. The horizontal bar with flags in this chart is packed and therefore difficult to identify the countries in a split second.\nDouble Headers: There are double titles in this chart: “Top markets by PEV sales volume” and “Top markets by PEV market share.” The chart does not clearly distinguish these two groups in the graph. Instead, it plots the two data together where it is not clear what each bar shows.\nThe Graph Fails to Clearly Show the Categories: There is no distinct graphical difference between “PEV sales volume” and “PEV market share.” The chart tries to combine them without segmentation or explanation of the differences. This can make viewers unsure whether the bars are of market share or volume.\nInconsistent Bar Width: Bars appear to be of consistent width; however, there are flags and labels on each bar that, to some degree, visually distort it and make the true values ambiguous. Sometimes, they are much larger than the bars themselves and not very clear.\nLabeling of Y-axis: The label on the y-axis, “Percentage of plug-in passenger cars in use”, is a little ambiguous since this chart is looking at volume and market share. A little clearer labeling would add to the understanding.\nInformation Overload: The chart tries to convey too much information at once without a clear visual or textual guide on how to interpret it. Simplification of content by focusing on one metric at a time will reduce cognitive overload: for example, either market share or sales volume.\n\nIt can be Redesigned as given below to give clearer insights:\n\nIn the visualization redesign the y-label is splitted into two: Top Markets by PEV market share and Top Markets by PEV market volume with the countries national flag. Both the graphs are shown in the same window to be compared with each other respectively to their changes in the year December 2023. Where the comparisions can be made easily with their respective shares.\nIt can be shown in another Redesigned way to get insights.\n\nThis visualization map gives a good geographic visualization in comparing PEV volume and shares of different countries. The two metrics and labeling of the countries is done to make the comparison and more user-friendly by using a interactive visualization.PEV volume green colour is been represented and for market share blue colour is represented.\nYou can read more about plug-in electric vehicles in Norway on Wikipedia."

The leading regions of road traffic deaths are Africa, the Americas, South-East Asia, and rather high figures in the Western Pacific, too. As many as 62% of fatalities take place in just 10 countries, headed by India, China, the U.S., Russia, and Brazil. Developing countries account for about 90% of road traffic deaths, while over half of the world’s registered vehicles are owned by high-income countries. Poor-country death rates average about 21.5 per 100,000, with middle-income countries averaging 19.5 per 100,000, while the rate in high-income countries is the lowest, about 10.3 per 100,000. The infographic also focuses on the lack of road safety legislation: just 49% of countries have laws setting a maximum blood alcohol concentration limit, 57% have requirements on use of seatbelts, and only 40% have comprehensive helmet-wearing laws. Vulnerable road users include cyclists, pedestrians, and motorcyclists who account for 50% of those dying from traffic accidents.\n\nFLAWS IN DESIGN\n\nThere are several flaws in this visualization that makes it less effective. First, the very basis of comparing population and road traffic deaths with pie and donut charts is misleading, since values cannot be accurately compared, especially when they are very similar. These are better represented by bar charts for comparison. The map and charts overuse the orange color, which results in a lack of contrast that reduces clarity in categorization. This could be very bad for colorblind viewers. Some of the texts, especially in the law-related information, are too tiny to read comfortably. The layout is cluttered; there are so many elements competing in the creation of visual clutter, which is supposed to overwhelm the processing of information. The abuse in visual presentation-mixing maps, pie charts, and icons-all put together on this page-creates further confusion. The regions are not clear on the map; circles obscure them, and their sizes do not relate to the number of deaths that might mislead one’s reasoning. It would have been infinitely better if there wasn’t so much information on one infographic but rather divided into separate visuals: fatalities, vehicle ownership, and laws being just a few.\n\nNEED FOR REDESIGN\n\nThere is much information in this visualization that is important, yet the overuse of orange, pie charts, and crowding only detract from effectiveness. The redesign must focus on clarity, reducing cognitive load, enhancing color contrast, and presenting data in a manner that makes comparison and understanding easy.\nTHE REDESIGNED GRAPHS ARE:-\n\nThis redesigned visualization is a side-by-side bar chart comparing vehicle ownership and road traffic deaths across three-income groups: high-income, low-income, and middle-income countries. For each of the three income groups, there are two bars: one showing in blue the percentage of vehicles owned and another showing in red the percentage of road traffic deaths.These high-income countries, which have a huge share of global vehicle ownership, still accounted for relatively small rates of road-traffic deaths.While vehicle ownership is highly concentrated in a few countries, the share of deaths from traffic is disproportionately high in low-income countries. Middle income countries are at a middle point, with reasonable vehicle ownership yet still a high percentage of road traffic deaths.\n\nThis is a redesign of the above visualization, in which a stacked bar chart compares high-, middle-, and low-income countries across three categories: Population, Registered Vehicles, and Road Traffic Deaths. It gives the proportional share of the different income groups within such categories. The middle-income countries would represent the highest share of the global population, while high-income countries own the majority of the world’s registered vehicles. However, a disproportionately high number of road traffic deaths are recorded in low- and middle-income countries. High-income countries enjoy better road safety, with fewer road traffic deaths compared to their population. This visualization clearly shows the big gap between vehicle ownership and fatalities from traffic, hence emphasizing that low- and middle-income countries bear the bulk of road traffic deaths when the number of vehicles owned is few.\nYou can read more about Road Accidents Wikipedia."
